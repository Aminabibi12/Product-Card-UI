                              **Product Card Web Page**


This is a simple React web page to showcase products and manage a shopping cart.

Features:


1. Product List: Displays products with images, prices, and size variants.

2. Add to Cart: Choose a variant and add products to the cart.

3. Cart Icon: Shows the number of items in the cart.

4. Cart Dropdown: View all added items with their variant and price.

5. Live Total: The cart shows the updated total price as items are added or removed.

6. Remove Items: Remove individual items directly from the cart.



Layout approach


1. The page uses a flexbox layout to arrange product cards in a row with gaps between them.

2. The main container has padding and centered headings for a clean, balanced look.



Responsiveness considerations


1. Font sizes use CSS clamp() for smooth scaling on different screen sizes.

2. The product cards wrap or adjust spacing to fit smaller screens gracefully.
